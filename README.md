# TFL_Detection

Mobileye Project- TFL Detection and Distance Estimation - Exellenteam Bootcamp, Sep 2021

Detecting traffic lights and estimating their distance from a moving vehicle. Using image processing technologies, Neural networks, and SFM

General Steps:

Detecting lights in an image using a kernel.

Gathering points that are candidates for a TFL.

Passing the candidates to a pre-trained Neural Network for determination - TFL or not.

Distinguish red and green Traffic lights.

Calculate the distances of the Traffic lights from the vehicle using SFM (structure from motion) by multiple images - clip frames.
